History=Nineteen of these ships were completed between 1975 and 1985. Each ship can carry 10 main battle tanks or 25 armored personel carriers along with 340 troops, representing all of the vehicles and 25% of the men of an infantry battalion (the rest of which would be embarked on conventional transports such as the Amguema). Like the bigger Alligator, the Ropuchas are designed for roll-on, roll-off operations with bow and stern ramps feeding a continous vehicle deck, the bottom of the hull behing sloped so that the ship can nose up on a beach to deliver vehicles directly.\nThe ships are also fitted with rocket launchers for supporting amphibious operations with artillery fire.
