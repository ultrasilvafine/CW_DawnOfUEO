ShipClass=Juliet
Description=Juliet-class Cruise Missile Submarine
History=These boats, built during the 1960's, are first-generation Soviet cruise missile boats, designed as cheaper diesel-electric equivalents of the Echo-class SSGN's. Like the Echos, they are very loud boats, even by diesel-electric standards. They also have to stay on the surface in order to target, launch and guide their SS-N-3 missiles, during which they are extremely vulnerable to NATO ASW. With the advent of submerged-launch missiles in the Charlie- and Oscar classes, these obsolete boats are probably retained as a means to harass NATO merchant convoys.
